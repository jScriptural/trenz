  title: "HOW EXCHANGE RATE AFFECT PRICES IN NIGERIA: A SIMPLE, NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION",
  html: `<p>In Nigeria, the recent surge in prices of commodities is attributed to the fluctuations in value of the naira in relation to other currencies e.g the dollar.<br />
  One may wonder how the value of the dollar in relation to the naira contributes to the changing prices of commodities in Nigeria.<br/>
Before delving into how exchange rate affects the prices of goods in Nigeria, We must take a detour to understand what exchage rate is and the factors affecting the exchange rate of a currency.<br /><br />
The exchange rate of a currency determines how much of one currency you can buy with another.
It also shows how much one currency is worth in terms of another. The exchange rate of a currency against another currency  is the purchasing power of the currency compared to the other currency.<br/>
For example, the exchange rate of the Nigerian naira with respect to the US dollar, is how much naira is required in exchange for one US dollar and vice versa.<br />

The exchange rate of a currency is constantly changing depending on several factors including changes in economic policy of the country, economic crisis, national security, and the exportation and importation of goods(internation trade).
On the other hand, the prices of commodities within a country is affected by changes in money supply, changes in the demand and supply of the commodity and the importation cost of the commodity or the raw materials required in the production of the commodity(cost of production).<br />
<br />
The Nigerian economy  relies heavily on  crude oil exports, which account for about 90% of its foreign revenues and 6.33% of its Gross Domestic Product(<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr>).The exchange rate of the naira is significantly  influenced by this oil revenue, which,  in turn, is subject to global oil price fluctuations. Even slight changes in the global oil price can have a significant impact the exchange rate of the naira.<br />
Since no country operates in isolation, the production cost of certain products within a country depends on the import cost of its raw materials. If the value of the naira depreciates, it means more naira will be required to import these raw materials, resulting in higher production costs for the given product. Producers typically pass on these increased costs to consumers through price hikes,hence the increase in commodity prices.<br /><br />
In summary,a decrease in foreign revenues impact the naira's exchange rate,which, in turn,drives up production costs, resulting in price hikes.

The exchange rate dey change steady steady based on plenty things like how the country economy dey do, any economic wahala, how the country dey secure, and how dem dey import and export goods. For inside the country, the price of things dey change based on how much money dey circulate, how much people dey ask for the thing, and how much e dey cost to import or produce am.<br />
<br />
Naija economy depend mostly on oil wey dem dey sell outside, wey dey bring plenty money wey be like 90% of wetin dem dey collect from abroad and 6.33% of everything wey the country dey produce.. The naira value dey shake well well based on how oil dey sell for global market. If the oil price change small, e fit affect how much naira dey worth.<br />
Because no country dey do things alone, the cost to produce some things for inside we country dey depend on how much e go cost to import the materials to carry make am. If naira value fall, e mean say e go cost more naira to import these materials, and e go cost more to produce the thing. People wey dey produce go come put the cost for top the price, so we go dey buy the thing for higher price.<br />
<br />
In short, if the money wey Naija dey get from outside reduce, e go affect how much naira dey worth, and e go make production cost increase, wey  go come  make prices of things increase too.
