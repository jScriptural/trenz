  <h3 style="font-weight: bold;color:#00bdd6">1. GREAT WALL OF CHINA</h3>
  <p>The <b>Great World of China</b> is a series of fortifications made of various materials including stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against raids and invasions by various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220–206 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi). This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of its branches measure out to be 21,196 km (13,171 mi).</p><br/><br/>
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold;color: #00bdd6">2. CRISTO REDENTOR</h3>
  <p><b>Cristo Redentor</b>(English: <i>Christ the Redeemer</i>)
  is an art deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heltor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with french engineer Albert Caquot.<br/>

  <p>The <b>Colosseum</b> is an elliptical amphitheatre(an open-air venue for entertainment and sports) in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.

  </figure>
  <p>The Colosseum is built of travertine(a form of limestone), tuff(volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete.<br />
  The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.<br />
  It is one of Rome’s most popular tourist attractions. </p><br />
  <br />
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold;color: #00bdd6">4. PETRA</h3>
  <p><b>Petra</b> is a historic and archaelogical city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also known as the "Rose City" because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved.<br />
  Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Arab Nabataeans, it is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan’s most-visited tourist attraction.
  <br />
  It lies on the slope of Jebel al-Madhbah (identified by some as the biblical Mount Hor) in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba), the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has been a <abbr title="United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> World Heritage Site since 1985.
